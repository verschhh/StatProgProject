To conduct an EDA focused on variation in this Airbnb listings dataset, I'll examine variations across several dimensions such as price, room type, availability, and reviews. I'll also provide equivalent R commands to replicate the analysis and plots in R using the tidyverse package.

Let’s explore variation across key metrics: Price by Neighborhood and Room Type, Availability (days per year), and Review Patterns.

1. Price Analysis by Neighborhood and Room Type
This analysis explores how prices vary across different neighborhoods and room types.

Data Analysis and Plotting in R

---------------------------------

# Load necessary libraries
library(tidyverse)

# Read the dataset
data <- read.csv("path_to_csv/listings.csv")

# Calculate average price by neighborhood and room type
avg_price <- data %>%
  filter(!is.na(price)) %>%
  group_by(neighbourhood_group, room_type) %>%
  summarise(mean_price = mean(price, na.rm = TRUE))

# Plotting average price by neighborhood and room type
ggplot(avg_price, aes(x = neighbourhood_group, y = mean_price, fill = room_type)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +
  labs(title = "Average Price by Neighborhood and Room Type",
       x = "Neighborhood Group", y = "Average Price") +
  theme_minimal()

---------------------------------

Observations
Certain neighborhoods, particularly in more central regions, may have higher prices.
Room type affects pricing significantly, with entire homes or apartments likely commanding higher prices than private rooms.
2. Availability Analysis
This step examines how availability varies across different room types and neighborhoods. Listings with higher availability might indicate less demand or a longer minimum stay requirement.

Data Analysis and Plotting in R

---------------------------------

# Calculate average availability by neighborhood and room type
avg_availability <- data %>%
  group_by(neighbourhood_group, room_type) %>%
  summarise(mean_availability = mean(availability_365, na.rm = TRUE))

# Plotting average availability by neighborhood and room type
ggplot(avg_availability, aes(x = neighbourhood_group, y = mean_availability, fill = room_type)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +
  labs(title = "Average Availability by Neighborhood and Room Type",
       x = "Neighborhood Group", y = "Average Availability (Days per Year)") +
  theme_minimal()

---------------------------------

Observations
Central areas might have lower availability as they are in high demand.
Private rooms may have higher availability compared to entire homes or apartments due to lower demand or shorter stay requirements.
3. Review Frequency Analysis
We analyze review counts and review frequency (reviews per month) to see how listings vary in terms of popularity and engagement.

Data Analysis and Plotting in R

---------------------------------

# Filter out rows with NA values in reviews_per_month
data_reviews <- data %>% filter(!is.na(reviews_per_month))

# Calculate average reviews per month by neighborhood and room type
avg_reviews <- data_reviews %>%
  group_by(neighbourhood_group, room_type) %>%
  summarise(mean_reviews_per_month = mean(reviews_per_month, na.rm = TRUE))

# Plotting average reviews per month by neighborhood and room type
ggplot(avg_reviews, aes(x = neighbourhood_group, y = mean_reviews_per_month, fill = room_type)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +
  labs(title = "Average Reviews per Month by Neighborhood and Room Type",
       x = "Neighborhood Group", y = "Average Reviews per Month") +
  theme_minimal()

---------------------------------

Observations
Listings in certain neighborhoods have higher review rates, indicating popularity or high turnover.
Entire homes might have fewer reviews per month than private rooms if they’re booked for longer stays.
4. Minimum Nights Requirement Analysis
This section analyzes the minimum stay requirement across neighborhoods and room types, which can impact pricing and availability.

---------------------------------

Data Analysis and Plotting in R
# Calculate median minimum nights requirement by neighborhood and room type
median_min_nights <- data %>%
  group_by(neighbourhood_group, room_type) %>%
  summarise(median_minimum_nights = median(minimum_nights, na.rm = TRUE))

# Plotting median minimum nights requirement by neighborhood and room type
ggplot(median_min_nights, aes(x = neighbourhood_group, y = median_minimum_nights, fill = room_type)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +
  labs(title = "Median Minimum Nights Requirement by Neighborhood and Room Type",
       x = "Neighborhood Group", y = "Median Minimum Nights") +
  theme_minimal()

---------------------------------

Observations
Listings in tourist-heavy areas may have longer minimum night requirements.
Entire homes often have higher minimum night requirements than private rooms.
Summary of Findings
Pricing: Prices vary notably by room type and neighborhood, with entire homes generally being more expensive, especially in central areas.
Availability: Availability is generally lower in high-demand neighborhoods, with private rooms often showing more availability.
Review Patterns: Higher review frequency is associated with specific neighborhoods and room types, indicating higher demand.
Minimum Nights Requirement: Entire homes have higher minimum night requirements than private rooms, which might be aimed at reducing turnover.
These insights help understand trends and inform further decisions on price setting, neighborhood analysis, and predicting demand. Let me know if you'd like to dive deeper into any specific area or analysis!



















Personal EDA: 
One thing that could be explored is the repartition of room type by region to see if it teaches us anything new. After seeing the encouraging result (cf Room Type by neighborhood_group.png) I tried to check with the neighborhood but the result were too messy (Room Type by Neighborhood.png).
----
command used:
ggplot(data, aes(x = neighbourhood_group, y = room_type, fill = room_type)) + geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") + labs(title = "Room Type by Neighborhood group", x = "Neighborhood Group", y = "Room Type") + theme_minimal()

ggplot(data, aes(x = neighbourhood, y = room_type, fill = room_type)) + geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") + labs(title = "Room Type by Neighborhood", x = "Neighborhood" , y = "Room Type") + theme_minimal()
----

Now i am trying to see if the price gives us any indication on the neighborhood group (higher price *should* be in the center.
As expected the central region price are way higher than the other but the East region price is also significantly higher than the other even it's still lower than the central region (cf Price by Neighborhood group.png)

----
command used:
ggplot(data, aes(x = neighbourhood_group, y = price, fill = room_type)) + geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") + labs(title = "Price by Neighborhood group", x = "Neighborhood group" , y = "Price") + theme_minimal()
----

With what i learned so far, i guess the next step should be to try and check the minimum stay by the price. But it wasn't as conclusive as i hoped it to be (Minimum stay by price.png)
